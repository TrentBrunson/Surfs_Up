Examining weather in Oahu for peak season months(June and December). Then used the describe method to get the data and used the to_html function to post the table using Flask.

### Summary and Recommendations  
---
####  
Comparing June and December, there is only a 4 degree temperature difference (cooler in December), and rain is more frequent with larger amounts in December.

For future analysis about customer behaviors and patterns, analyzing weather date with consumer spending patterns in Oahu may reveal other opportunities to capitalize on.  For instance, Oahu's North Shore attraction may drive surf sales in winter months.  Including surf conditions for a surf shop analysis will probably deliver particularly useful insights.

Additionally, tourist spending in summer seasons may be driven by 'sun worshippers', whereas winter months may invite eco-tourism such as whale watching during migration season.  Merging types of customer spending with weather and surf reports could help drive more effective marketing communication decisions, making better use of those funds by hyping what's already on the mind of the customer (e.g. ice cream in summer, surf's up in winter, etc.).
